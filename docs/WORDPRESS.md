## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I deploy a landing page?
Send a `POST` request with a JSON body containing a base64 ZIP (`zip_base64`) to:

```
/wp-json/static-page-publisher/v1/update-landing
```

Include your access token in the request headers or query parameters.

---

### Will this override my existing front page?
Yes. The plugin automatically serves the uploaded landing page on your siteâ€™s **front page**.
Your original theme files are not modified.

---

### Is my token secure?
Tokens are stored in the WordPress database and should be treated like API keys.
Rotate tokens periodically for best security practices.
